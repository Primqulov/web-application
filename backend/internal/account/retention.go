// Retention: deleting an account is a two-stage process.
//
// Stage 1 (immediate, see softDelete): the account is flagged isDeleted, its
// identity is released (phone/telegramId unset and archived to deleted*), its
// listings leave the feed and its in-flight applications are cancelled. From
// this moment the account is unreachable — every API call with its old token is
// rejected with 403 account_disabled and no other user can see it.
//
// Stage 2 (this file, after RetentionDays): everything is destroyed for good.
// The user document, their listings, applications, notifications, reports,
// feedback, one-time codes and uploaded files are hard-deleted from MongoDB and
// object storage, including the archived deletedPhone/deletedTelegramId. After
// stage 2 nothing linking back to the person remains.
//
// The window exists so a user who deleted by mistake (or under a hijacked
// session) can contact support and be told what happened, and so fraud/abuse
// reports filed just before the deletion can still be acted on. Google Play's
// account-deletion policy allows exactly this kind of bounded grace period as
// long as it is disclosed — it is, on /delete-account and in the privacy policy.
